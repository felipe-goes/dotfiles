# Shortcuts for vim-tmux-navigator

This plugin provides the following mappings which allow you to move between Vim panes and tmux splits seamlessly.

~~~
<ctrl-h> => Left
<ctrl-j> => Down
<ctrl-k> => Up
<ctrl-l> => Right
<ctrl-\> => Previous split
~~~

Note - you don't need to use your tmux `prefix` key sequence before using the mappings.

If you want to use alternate key mappings, see the configuration section below.
