# Give me a project structure that follows best practices in developing a game using sdl2, c++ and cmake and show me how to build it.

Certainly! Let's design a clean project structure following best practices for
developing a game using SDL2, C++, and CMake. Here is a recommended directory
layout:

```
my_platformer_game/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── build/
├── src/
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   ├── main.cpp
│   ├── Game.cpp
│   ├── Game.h
│   ├── Player.cpp
│   ├── Player.h
│   └── ... (other source and header files)
├── include/
│   └── ... (header files)
├── assets/
│   └── ... (game assets like images, sounds, etc.)
└── tests/
    ├── CMakeLists.txt
    └── ... (unit tests)
```

## Step 1: Initialize Project Structure

```
mkdir -p my_platformer_game/{build,src,include,assets,tests}
cd my_platformer_game
```

## Step 2: Create Root CMakeLists.txt

```
# my_platformer_game/CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyPlatformerGame VERSION 1.0)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)

add_subdirectory(src)
add_subdirectory(tests)
```

## Step 3: Create `src` Subdirectory CMakeLists.txt

```
# my_platformer_game/src/CMakeLists.txt
file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES "*.cpp")
file(GLOB_RECURSE HEADERS "*.h")

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES} ${HEADERS})

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)

find_package(SDL2 REQUIRED)
find_package(SDL2_image REQUIRED)

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${SDL2_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS})
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${SDL2_LIBRARIES} ${SDL2_IMAGE_LIBRARIES})
```

## Step 4: Create Source Files

#### src/main.cpp

```
#include "Game.h"

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    Game game;
    if (game.Initialize()) {
        game.Run();
    }
    game.Cleanup();
    return 0;
}
```

### src/Game.h

```
#ifndef GAME_H
#define GAME_H

#include <SDL2/SDL.h>
#include <SDL2/SDL_image.h>

class Game {
public:
    Game();
    ~Game();
    bool Initialize();
    void Run();
    void Cleanup();

private:
    SDL_Window* window;
    SDL_Renderer* renderer;

    bool isRunning;
    void ProcessInput();
    void Update();
    void Render();
};

#endif // GAME_H
```

#### src/Game.cpp

```
#include "Game.h"
#include <iostream>

Game::Game() : window(nullptr), renderer(nullptr), isRunning(false) {}

Game::~Game() {}

bool Game::Initialize() {
    if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) < 0) {
        std::cerr << "SDL could not initialize! SDL_Error: " <<
        SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
    return false;
    }

    window = SDL_CreateWindow("My Platformer Game", SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
    SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED, 800, 600, SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN);

    if (window == nullptr) {
        std::cerr << "Window could not be created! SDL_Error: " <<
        SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
        return false;
    }

    renderer = SDL_CreateRenderer(window, -1, SDL_RENDERER_ACCELERATED | SDL_RENDERER_PRESENTVSYNC);

    if (renderer == nullptr) {
        std::cerr << "Renderer could not be created! SDL_Error: " <<
        SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
        return false;
    }

    int imgFlags = IMG_INIT_PNG;
    if (!(IMG_Init(imgFlags) & imgFlags)) {
        std::cerr << "SDL_image could not initialize! SDL_image Error: " <<
        IMG_GetError() << std::endl;
        return false;
    }

    isRunning = true;
    return true;
}

void Game::Run() {
    while (isRunning) {
        ProcessInput();
        Update();
        Render();
    }
}

void Game::Cleanup() {
    SDL_DestroyRenderer(renderer);
    SDL_DestroyWindow(window);
    IMG_Quit();
    SDL_Quit();
}

void Game::ProcessInput() {
    SDL_Event event;
    while (SDL_PollEvent(&event)) {
        if (event.type == SDL_QUIT) {
            isRunning = false;
        }
        // Handle other input events (e.g., keyboard, mouse) here...
    }
}

void Game::Update() {
    // Update game state here...
}

void Game::Render() {
    SDL_SetRenderDrawColor(renderer, 0, 0, 0, 255);
    SDL_RenderClear(renderer);
    // Render game objects here...
    SDL_RenderPresent(renderer);
}
```

## Step 5: Configure CMake and Build

1. Navigate to the build directory:

```
    cd my_platformer_game/build
```

2. Configure the project with CMake:

```
    cmake ..
```

3. Build the project:

```
    make
```

## Step 6: Run the Game

```
    ./MyPlatformerGame
```

This setup provides a solid foundation for further expansion. You can add more
classes (e.g., `Player`, `Enemy`) into separate header and source files, and
organize them under the `src/` directory. Use `include/` for shared header
files and `assets/` for game assets like textures and sounds.

### Testing Framework (Optional)

For unit tests, you can use a testing framework like Google Test. Include it as
a subdirectory and create test cases in the `tests/` directory.

tests/CMakeLists.txt:

```
# my_platformer_game/tests/CMakeLists.txt
enable_testing()

find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
include_directories(${GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS})

file(GLOB_RECURSE TEST_SOURCES "*.cpp")

add_executable(tests_run ${TEST_SOURCES})
target_link_libraries(tests_run ${GTEST_LIBRARIES} pthread)

add_test(NAME tests_run COMMAND tests_run)
```

You can then add test files inside `tests/` and build them in the same way.

### Next Steps

- Expand the Game class functionality with more subsystems (e.g., `Player`,
  `Level`, `Physics`).
- Load and render textures using SDL2_image.
- Add sound effects and music using SDL2_mixer.
- Implement game mechanics like player movement, jumping, collisions, etc.
- Add tests to ensure the stability of game logic using Google Test or another
  preferred testing framework.

Feel free to ask more questions if you have any!

# I got this error when I ran make: /usr/include/SDL2/SDL_config.h:4:10: fatal error: 'SDL2/\_real_SDL_config.h' file not found

This error is due to a known issue where incorrect include paths can cause SDL2
to not find its internal configuration header file. To fix this, we need to
ensure correct include directories are set for SDL2 in the CMakeLists.txt and
adjust the way SDL2 is found.

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. Check for SDL2 Configuration Issue:Make sure you have installed SDL2
   development libraries properly. You can verify with:

```
    sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev
```

2. Update CMakeLists.txt to Find SDL2 Correctly: Adjust the
   `src/CMakeLists.txt` file to properly configure the SDL2 library paths.

```
# my_platformer_game/src/CMakeLists.txt
file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES "*.cpp")
file(GLOB_RECURSE HEADERS "*.h")

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES} ${HEADERS})

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)

find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)
pkg_search_module(SDL2 REQUIRED sdl2)
pkg_search_module(SDL2IMAGE REQUIRED SDL2_image)

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${SDL2IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS})
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${SDL2_LIBRARIES} ${SDL2IMAGE_LIBRARIES})
```

This will use `pkg-config` to find the correct paths for SDL2 and SDL2_image.

3. Additional CMake Lists Adjustments:If you still face issues, you might want
   to explicitly specify the include directories and libraries within your
   CMakeLists.txt.

```
# Define the platform-specific include directory and the library linker path
include_directories(/usr/include/SDL2)

# Linking SDL2 to the project
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE SDL2 SDL2_image)
```

4. Re-configure and Re-build the Project:After adjusting the CMakeLists.txt, re-
   configure and re-build the project.

```
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
```

By ensuring SDL2 is properly found and configured within the CMake setup, this
problem can be resolved, allowing you to proceed with developing your game. If
you continue to run into issues, please ensure you do not have conflicting SDL2
installations and that the installation paths are correct. Debugging
`find_package` outputs and `pkg-config` results can also be helpful in such
cases.

Here is the entire updated `src/CMakeLists.txt` for clarity:

```
# my_platformer_game/src/CMakeLists.txt
file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES "*.cpp")
file(GLOB_RECURSE HEADERS "*.h")

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES} ${HEADERS})

target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)

find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)
pkg_search_module(SDL2 REQUIRED sdl2)
pkg_search_module(SDL2IMAGE REQUIRED SDL2_image)

include_directories(${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${SDL2IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS})
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${SDL2_LIBRARIES} ${SDL2IMAGE_LIBRARIES})
```

Make sure you properly invoke `pkg-config` and have the necessary development
packages installed. If `pkg-config` is not installed, you can install it with:

```
    sudo apt-get install pkg-config
```

Good luck with your project, and let me know if you need any more help!

# Explain the cmake configurations for this project.

Sure! Understanding the CMake configurations will help you customize and extend
your project easily. Let's break down the essential parts of the CMake
configuration for the project.

## Root CMakeLists.txt

The root `CMakeLists.txt` file is the entry point for the CMake build system.
Here are the key sections:

```
# my_platformer_game/CMakeLists.txt

# Minimum CMake version required for this project
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)

# Define the project name and version
project(MyPlatformerGame VERSION 1.0)

# Set C++ standard to C++17 and make it required
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)

# Add subdirectories for source files and tests
add_subdirectory(src)
add_subdirectory(tests)
```

### Breakdown:

1. Minimum Required Version:
   - `cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)` ensures that the CMake version is
     at least 3.10 to support the needed features.
2. Project Declaration:
   - `project(MyPlatformerGame VERSION 1.0)` declares the project name and
     version.
3. C++ Standard:
   - `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)` sets the C++ standard to C++17.
   - `set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)` makes it mandatory.
4. Add Subdirectories:
   - `add_subdirectory(src)` includes the `src` directory for building the main
     application.
   - `add_subdirectory(tests)` includes the `tests` directory for unit tests.

## Source Directory CMakeLists.txt

The `src/CMakeLists.txt` handles the source files, headers, includes, and
library linking.

```
# my_platformer_game/src/CMakeLists.txt

# Collect all .cpp and .h files in src/ directory
file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES "*.cpp")
file(GLOB_RECURSE HEADERS "*.h")

# Create the executable using the collected source files
add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES} ${HEADERS})

# Include directories paths for header files
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)

# Use pkg-config to find SDL2 and SDL2_image details
find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)
pkg_search_module(SDL2 REQUIRED sdl2)
pkg_search_module(SDL2IMAGE REQUIRED SDL2_image)

# Add include directories for SDL2 and SDL2_image
include_directories(${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${SDL2IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# Link SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries to the executable
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${SDL2_LIBRARIES} ${SDL2IMAGE_LIBRARIES})
```

### Breakdown:

1. Source and Header Files:
   - `file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES "*.cpp")` collects all `.cpp` source files.
   - `file(GLOB_RECURSE HEADERS "*.h")` collects all `.h` header files.
2. Executable Creation:
   - `add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES} ${HEADERS})` creates the
     executable using collected source and header files. `${PROJECT_NAME}` is
     inherited from the root CMake file and equals `MyPlatformerGame`.
3. Include Directories:
   - `target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)`
     adds the `include` directory to the target's include path.
4. Finding SDL2 and SDL2_image with PkgConfig:
   - `find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)` ensures that `pkg-config` is available.
   - `pkg_search_module(SDL2 REQUIRED sdl2)` finds the SDL2 details using
     `pkg-config`.
   - `pkg_search_module(SDL2IMAGE REQUIRED SDL2_image)` finds the SDL2_image
     details using `pkg-config`.
5. Include Directories for SDL2:
   - `include_directories(${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS} ${SDL2IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS})` adds
     the SDL2 and SDL2_image include directories.
6. Linking Libraries:
   - `target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${SDL2_LIBRARIES} ${SDL2IMAGE_LIBRARIES})`
     links the SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries to the executable.

## Tests Directory CMakeLists.txt (Optional)

If you decide to add a testing framework and write unit tests, this is an
example of how to integrate it:

```
# my_platformer_game/tests/CMakeLists.txt
# Enable testing
enable_testing()

# Find Google Test library
find_package(GTest REQUIRED)
include_directories(${GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# Collect all .cpp test source files
file(GLOB_RECURSE TEST_SOURCES "*.cpp")

# Create an executable for running the tests
add_executable(tests_run ${TEST_SOURCES})
target_link_libraries(tests_run ${GTEST_LIBRARIES} pthread)

# Register the tests
add_test(NAME tests_run COMMAND tests_run)
```

### Breakdown:

1. Enable Testing:
   - `enable_testing()` enables CMake's testing features.
2. Finding Google Test:
   - `find_package(GTest REQUIRED)` finds the Google Test library.
   - `include_directories(${GTEST_INCLUDE_DIRS})` includes the directories for
     Google Test.
3. Test Sources:
   - `file(GLOB_RECURSE TEST_SOURCES "\*.cpp")` collects all `.cpp` test source
     files.
4. Executable for Tests:
   - `add_executable(tests_run ${TEST_SOURCES})` creates an executable for
     running the tests.
   - `target_link_libraries(tests_run ${GTEST_LIBRARIES} pthread)` links Google
     Test libraries and pthread for the test executable.
5. Register Tests:
   - `add_test(NAME tests_run COMMAND tests_run)` registers the executable as a
     test.

## Build and Clean Up

### Build Steps:

1. Navigate to the build directory:

```
    cd build
```

2. Configure the project with CMake:

```
    cmake ..
```

3. Build the project:

```
    make
```

### Run Steps:

1. Run the executable:

```
    ./MyPlatformerGame
```

### Testing Steps (if tests are configured):

1. Run tests:

```
    ctest
```

This setup should now be robust and easy to extend. Let me know if you have
more questions!

# When and how should I use target_include_directories, include_directories and target_link_libraries?

Understanding when and how to use `target_include_directories`,
`include_directories`, and `target_link_libraries` is crucial for efficiently
managing dependencies and controlling the build process in CMake. Here's a
detailed explanation:

## `target_include_directories`

This command is used to specify include directories for a particular target
(like an executable or a library). It is the more modern and recommended way to
specify include directories in CMake as it provides fine-grained control over
scoping and can be applied to specific targets.

Usage:

```
    target_include_directories(<target> [SYSTEM] [AFTER|BEFORE]
      <INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items1...])
```

- `<target>`: The target (executable or library) to which you want to add
  include directories.
- `SYSTEM`: Marks the include directories as system include directories (on
  supported compilers, this suppresses warnings).
- `AFTER|BEFORE`: Specifies the order of the include directories relative to
  existing directories.
- `<INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE>`: Scoping of the include directories:
  - `PRIVATE`: The include directories are used only by the target itself.
  - `PUBLIC`: The include directories are used by the target and by any targets
    that link against this target.
  - `INTERFACE`: The include directories are used only by targets that link
    against this target.

Example:

```
    target_include_directories(MyTarget PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
    target_include_directories(MyTarget PUBLIC ${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```

## `include_directories`

This command is an older CMake command for adding include directories. It
affects all targets in a directory and its subdirectories, so it's less precise
than `target_include_directories`.

Usage:

```
    include_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] [SYSTEM] [DIRECTORY1 [DIRECTORY2 ...]])
```

- `AFTER|BEFORE`: Specifies whether the directories are added after or before
  the current list of include directories.
- `SYSTEM`: Marks the include directories as system include directories.
- `DIRECTORY1 [DIRECTORY2 ...]`: The directories to add to the include path.

Example:

```
    include_directories(${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include ${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS})
```

## `target_link_libraries`

This command is used to link libraries to a particular target. It ensures that
when the target is built, the specified libraries are linked with it.

Usage:

```
    target_link_libraries(<target> [INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE] <library>...)
```

- `<target>`: The target to which you want to link libraries.
- `<INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE>`: Scoping of the libraries:
  - `PRIVATE`: The library is used only by the target itself.
  - `PUBLIC`: The library is used by the target and by any targets that link
    against this target.
  - `INTERFACE`: The library is used only by targets that link against this
    target.

Example:

```
    target_link_libraries(MyTarget PRIVATE ${SDL2_LIBRARIES})
```

## Practical Examples

Now, let's apply these commands to your project's context.

### Root `CMakeLists.txt`

```
# my_platformer_game/CMakeLists.txt

cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyPlatformerGame VERSION 1.0)

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED True)

add_subdirectory(src)
add_subdirectory(tests)
```

### Source Directory CMakeLists.txt

```
# my_platformer_game/src/CMakeLists.txt

# Collect all .cpp and .h files in src/ directory
file(GLOB_RECURSE SOURCES "*.cpp")
file(GLOB_RECURSE HEADERS "*.h")

# Create the executable using the collected source files
add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} ${SOURCES} ${HEADERS})

# Use pkg-config to find SDL2 and SDL2_image details
find_package(PkgConfig REQUIRED)
pkg_search_module(SDL2 REQUIRED sdl2)
pkg_search_module(SDL2IMAGE REQUIRED SDL2_image)

# Include directories for SDL2 and SDL2_image
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include)
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS})
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ${SDL2IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS})

# Link SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries to the executable
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${SDL2_LIBRARIES})
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${SDL2IMAGE_LIBRARIES})
```

Here:

1. target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/include):
   - Adds the `include` directory to the include path for `${PROJECT_NAME}` and
     only for this target (`PRIVATE` scope).
2. target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PUBLIC ${SDL2_INCLUDE_DIRS}):
   - Ensures that the SDL2 include directories are added to both this target
     and to any target that links against this target (`PUBLIC` scope).
3. target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${SDL2_LIBRARIES}):
   - Links the SDL2 libraries to `${PROJECT_NAME}` and ensures they are only
     required when building this target (`PRIVATE` scope).

By using these commands properly, you ensure that dependencies are handled
correctly, and your project structure is clean and maintainable. This scoped
and modular approach makes it easier to manage complex dependencies, especially
in larger projects.

## Summary

- target_include_directories: Preferred for modern CMake. Use to specify
  include directories per target. Choose `PRIVATE`, `PUBLIC`, or `INTERFACE`
  based on the scope needed.
- include_directories: Older, less precise method. Affects the directory and
  its subdirectories. Use sparingly.
- target_link_libraries: Links libraries to specific targets. Use `PRIVATE`,
  `PUBLIC`, or `INTERFACE` to control the scope of the linked libraries.

This approach ensures that your project configuration is both flexible and
maintainable. Let me know if you need more examples or deeper explanations on
any part!
