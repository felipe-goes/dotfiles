# How to setup user account to be able to make a request to stack exchange's api?

To set up a user account and make requests to the Stack Exchange API, you’ll
need to follow several steps. Here’s a detailed guide to help you through the
process:

## 1. Create a Stack Exchange Account

First, you need a Stack Exchange account. If you don’t have one:

- Go to any Stack Exchange site (e.g., Stack Overflow, Super User, etc.).
- Click on “Sign up” in the top right corner.
- Follow the instructions to create an account.

## 2. Register for an API Key

While you can make requests to the Stack Exchange API without an API key, having
one increases your daily quota of calls from 300 to 10,000, which is highly
beneficial for most applications.

- Go to the Stack Apps site.
- Click on “Register an Application”. You will be prompted to log in if you aren't already.
- Fill out the form:
    - **Application Name**: This should be something descriptive.
    - **OAuth Domain**: If you're not using OAuth, you can just put 'stackexchange.com'.
    - **Application Website**: A URL where users can go to download or learn
    more about your app. This can be a personal blog or GitHub repo if you
    don’t have a dedicated site.
- Agree to the terms of service, and submit the form.

After submitting the form, you will receive an API key. Keep this key secure as
it is your unique identifier for accessing the API.

## 3. Making API Requests

With your API key, you can start making requests to the Stack Exchange API.
Here’s a basic example using Python with the `requests` library:

```
# python

import requests

# Example: Fetch all questions tagged 'python' from Stack Overflow
url = "https://api.stackexchange.com/2.3/questions"
params = {
    'order': 'desc',
    'sort': 'creation',
    'tagged': 'python',
    'site': 'stackoverflow',
    'key': '[Your-API-Key]'  # Replace [Your-API-Key] with your actual API key
}

response = requests.get(url, params=params)
data = response.json()

print(data)
```

## 4. Handle Rate Limiting

Be aware of the rate limits:

- 10,000 requests per day with an API key.
- 300 requests per day without an API key.

If your application exceeds these limits, you will receive a 502/503 error from
the API.

## 5. Review API Documentation

To make the most out of the Stack Exchange API, review the [official
documentation](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs). It provides detailed
information on the endpoints available, the parameters you can use, and how to
format your requests.

6. Using OAuth

If your application requires actions on behalf of a user, such as accessing
private information or performing write actions, you’ll need to implement OAuth
authentication. The registration form you filled out on Stack Apps is also the
start of setting up OAuth.

Implementing OAuth goes beyond simple API requests and requires handling
redirects and securely storing access tokens. The Stack Exchange API
documentation provides a detailed guide on how to implement OAuth for user
authentication and authorization.

Following these steps should get you started with using the Stack Exchange API.
Remember to secure your API key and use the API responsibly to stay within the
usage guidelines and limits.

# How to make a request to stack exchange's api with go?

To make a request to the Stack Exchange API using the Go programming language,
you'll typically use the `net/http` package, which provides HTTP client and
server implementations. Below is a simple example of how to make a request to
retrieve questions tagged with "go" from Stack Overflow using the Stack Exchange
API.

## Step 1: Set Up Your Environment

Ensure you have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install it
from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

## Step 2: Write Your Go Code

Here is a simple Go program that fetches questions tagged with "go" from Stack
Overflow using the Stack Exchange API.

```
// go

package main

import (
    "encoding/json"
    "fmt"
    "io/ioutil"
    "log"
    "net/http"
    "net/url"
)

// Define a struct to parse the JSON response. This struct will only extract part of the response.
// Adjust it according to the data you need.
type ApiResponse struct {
    Items []struct {
        Title string `json:"title"`
        Link  string `json:"link"`
    } `json:"items"`
    QuotaRemaining int `json:"quota_remaining"`
}

func main() {
    // Set up the request parameters
    baseURL := "https://api.stackexchange.com/2.3/questions"
    params := url.Values{}
    params.Add("order", "desc")
    params.Add("sort", "creation")
    params.Add("tagged", "go")
    params.Add("site", "stackoverflow")
    params.Add("key", "YOUR_API_KEY") // Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual Stack Exchange API key

    // Build the request URL with parameters
    requestURL := fmt.Sprintf("%s?%s", baseURL, params.Encode())

    // Make the HTTP GET request
    resp, err := http.Get(requestURL)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to send request: %v", err)
    }
    defer resp.Body.Close()

    // Read and parse the response body
    body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(resp.Body)
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to read response body: %v", err)
    }

    // Unmarshal the JSON response into the ApiResponse struct
    var apiResponse ApiResponse
    if err := json.Unmarshal(body, &apiResponse); err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("Failed to unmarshal JSON response: %v", err)
    }

    // Print the remaining quota and the titles and links of the questions
    fmt.Printf("Quota Remaining: %d\n", apiResponse.QuotaRemaining)
    for _, item := range apiResponse.Items {
        fmt.Printf("Title: %s\nLink: %s\n", item.Title, item.Link)
    }
}
```

## Step 3: Run Your Code

Save your Go script as `main.go` and run it by typing the following in your
terminal:

```
# bash

go run main.go
```

## Important Notes

- **API Key**: You should replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual Stack Exchange
API key to increase your daily request limit and to track usage.
- **Error Handling**: The above example includes basic error handling. Ensure
that your production code robustly handles different types of errors (like
network errors, API rate limits, and more).
- **Response Parsing**: The JSON response from the API contains many more fields
than those parsed in the `ApiResponse` struct. Customize this struct based on
the actual data you need for your application.
- **HTTP Client Configuration**: In a production environment, configure the
HTTP client to manage timeouts and potentially keep connections alive for
multiple requests.

This simple example should help you start interacting with the Stack Exchange
API using Go. Modify the request parameters and structure as needed based on
the specifics of your application and what data you require from the API.

# Which are the parameters available for a request to stack exchange's api?

The Stack Exchange API offers a broad set of parameters that you can use to
customize your API requests. These parameters vary depending on the specific
endpoint you are accessing, but there are some common parameters that are
generally available across multiple endpoints. Below is an overview of some of
the key parameters you might use:

## Common Parameters Across Various Endpoints

- **site** - Specifies the Stack Exchange site to query. For example:
`stackoverflow`, `superuser`, `askubuntu`, etc.
- **q** - The search query keywords.
- **sort** - Determines how the results are sorted. Common values are `activity`,
`votes`, `creation`, `relevance`, etc. The available options can vary by
endpoint.
- **order** - Specifies whether the results should be returned in ascending
(`asc`) or descending (`desc`) order.
- **closed** - Filters for closed questions.
- **tagged** - Filters the results to only include entries that are tagged with
specific tags. This is particularly useful for endpoints that return questions.
- **untagged** - Filters results to entries that do not have certain tags.
- **title** - Searches for questions with a specific title.
- **intitle** - Returns only entries where the title contains a specified
string. This is useful for searching questions.
- **body** - Searches for questions with a specific body text.
- **fromdate** and todate - These are Unix timestamps that allow you to specify
the range of dates for your query.
- **url** - Searches for questions with a specific URL.
- **user** - Specifies a user's ID to search for questions posted by that
- **min** & **max** - These parameters work in conjunction with `sort` and allow
you to filter based on the values of the sort. For example, if you are sorting
by `creation`, you could specify a `min` date.
- **page** & **pagesize** - These control pagination. `page` specifies the page
of results to return, and `pagesize` can be used to determine the number of
items per page (typically capped at 100).
- **key** - Your application's API key. Using a key increases the number of
requests you can make per day.

## Parameters for /search/advanced endpoint

- **q** - a free form text parameter, will match all question properties based
on an undocumented algorithm.
- **accepted** - true to return only questions with accepted answers, false to
return only those without. Omit to elide constraint.
- **answers** - the minimum number of answers returned questions must have.
- **body** - text which must appear in returned questions' bodies.
- **closed** - true to return only closed questions, false to return only open
ones. Omit to elide constraint.
- **migrated** - true to return only questions migrated away from a site, false
to return only those not. Omit to elide constraint.
- **notice** - true to return only questions with post notices, false to return
only those without. Omit to elide constraint.
- **nottagged** - a semicolon delimited list of tags, none of which will be
present on returned questions.
- **tagged** - a semicolon delimited list of tags, of which at least one will
be present on all returned questions.
- **title** - text which must appear in returned questions' titles.
- **user** - the id of the user who must own the questions returned.
- **url** - a url which must be contained in a post, may include a wildcard.
- **views** - the minimum number of views returned questions must have.
- **wiki** - true to return only community wiki questions, false to return only
non-community wiki ones. Omit to elide constraint.

## Parameters for User Authentication and Actions

- **access_token** - Used for methods that require authentication. It represents
a user's login and allows actions on their behalf.

## Example Using `questions` Endpoint

For instance, the `/questions` endpoint, which retrieves all the questions on a
site, supports additional parameters specific to filtering questions:

- **answered** - Filters for questions that are answered or unanswered.
- **body** - Returns the body of the questions.
- **closed** - Includes or excludes closed questions.
- **migrated** - Includes or excludes questions that are migrated.
- **notice** - Includes or excludes questions with post notices.
- **nottagged** - Exclude questions with certain tags.
- **views** - Minimum number of views required to return.
- **user** - Filter by user ID.

## Example Request

Here's an example of how you might construct a URL to use some of these
parameters to search for recently created questions on Stack Overflow tagged
with `python`:

```
# bash

https://api.stackexchange.com/2.3/questions?order=desc&sort=creation&tagged=python&site=stackoverflow&pagesize=5&key=YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Documentation

For a comprehensive list of parameters and their explanations for each specific
API endpoint, you should refer directly to the [official Stack Exchange API](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs)
documentation. This documentation is very detailed and includes information on
the parameters supported by each endpoint, allowing you to tailor your requests
to your specific needs.

# Which are the available endpoints?
